Building the backend for an E Commerce site

Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I will take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

AS a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies. Given a functional Express.js API, when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file called .env, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize. When I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data to populate. When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core as an API testing and usage tool for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
